# Real-Time-RPLidar-Visualization-using-Python-and-Matplotlib
A Python-based real-time LiDAR visualization system using RPLidar and Matplotlib. The program captures 360-degree distance measurements, converts them to polar coordinates, and displays live obstacle scans on a polar plot. Designed for Raspberry Pi, it supports safe motor control and smooth real-time updates.
